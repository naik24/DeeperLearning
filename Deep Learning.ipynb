    "A machine learning model transforms its input data into meaningful outputs, a process that is learned from exposure to known examples of inputs and outputs. Therefore, the central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to meaningfully transform data: in other words, to learn useful representations of the input data at hand. But what is a representation? At its core, it's a different way to look at data - to represent or encode data. For instance, a color image can be encoded in the RGB format or in the HSV format: these are two representations of the same data. Machine learning models are all about finding appropriate representations for their input data - transformations of the data that make it more amenable to the task at hand, such as a classification task.\n",

    "*Machine learning is technically: searching for useful representations of some input data, within a predefined space of possibilities, using guidance from a feedback signal.*"
